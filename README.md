Projec title: Philosophy for Everyone: What Happened between Schools of Philosophy?

This project is conducted by Ying Gao

Project summary: In the philosophy history, schools have been founded and developed, made their statements, and understood phenomena and principles in different aspects. They were also influenced by each other during the long history of philosophy. (Hopefully this will raise your interest in philosophy!!) By this data mining based on more than 300,000 sentences collected from the major schools of philosophy, you would directly and simply capture the brief ideas, characteristics and relationships among them.
